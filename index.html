<h2>What is SAYDX?</h2>

<p>
  The Structured Array Data Exchange (SAYDX, pronounced as [səeɪdɪks]) is a
  multi-level protocol enabling a flexible and efficient exchange of structured
  array data between various application. It is currently being drafted by
  various contributors.
</p>

<p>
  We envision SAYDX as a hybrid of JSON and HDF5. It should allow to send
  complex messages between applications, each message containing a tree of named
  nodes with array data in the leafs. It should be a simple protocol enabling a
  lightweight implementation. It is supposed to support various transport
  layers, such as
  <ul>
    <li>File I/O (binary and text)</li>
    <li>Binary API (with C and Fortran interfaces)</li>
    <li>Socket communication</li>
    <li>MPI-communication</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  SAYDX should serve as a base protocol for higher level protocols, e.g. a
  protocol to exchange data between atomistic simulation packages.
